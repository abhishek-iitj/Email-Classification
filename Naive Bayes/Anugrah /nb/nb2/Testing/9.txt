Please consult your Head of the Department/Focus Group Convener before registering courses.

 

 Note following point before registering the courses : 

 

1.       Students with backlog courses are advised to register for the Basic Courses and complete them before registering for the Professional Courses.

In case, you have any confusion, please consult your Head of the Department.

 

2.       The following are the guidelines for choosing elective courses:

            Each course has a number, eg. CS651, 70035, 30002, etc. Please pay attention to the first digit of the course. The first digit indicates the level of the course. We have the following levels:

            Level 1 course: For 1st year UG students

Level 2 course: For 2nd year UG students

Level 3 course: For 3rd year UG students

Level 4 course: For 4th year UG students

Level 5 course: For M.Sc. students

Level 6 course: For M.Tech. students

Level 7 course: For Ph.D. students

 

 A student in the nth year can register for courses of levels n-1, n, n+1, n+2.

 

So a B.Tech. Final year student in 4th year can register for electives in level 3,4,5,6.

 

Please note that the M.Tech. and Ph.D. students cannot register for B.Tech. level courses.

 

An M.Tech. student can register for elective courses of level 5,6,7.

 

A 3rd year student can register for electives of level 2,3,4,5

 

A 2nd year student can register for electives of level 1,2,3,4
