Hi abhishekSah,

Congratulations! You have officially qualified for Online Round 1 of Code Jam 2017 based on your performance in the Qualification Round. We're impressed!

Unlike in the Qualification Round, collaboration is strictly prohibited in Round 1 and all future rounds of Code Jam 2017. Section 7 of the Google Code Jam Terms & Conditions prohibits sharing or using from others any information about a problem before the end of the round. Such actions that violate those Terms & Conditions will result in your disqualification. Moreover, please note that if you are utilizing a web integrated development environment (IDE), be sure to not publish your code or otherwise allow it to be publicly visible during the contest, or you could be subject to disqualification.

How does Round 1 work? There are three first rounds: Round 1A, Round 1B and Round 1C. Each lasts for two hours and thirty minutes. You can compete in as many of the sub-rounds (1A, 1B, and 1C) as you want. If you place in the top 1000 in any sub-round, you will qualify for Round 2 and you will not be allowed to compete in any later sub-rounds.

Round 1 Schedule

Round 1A: Saturday, April 15, 2017 at 01:00 UTC

Round 1B: Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 16:00 UTC

Round 1C: Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 09:00 UTC

See you in Round 1, and best of luck!

The Code Jam Team
