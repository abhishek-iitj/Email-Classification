Dear folks,

It is that time of the year when we begin fearing the dearth of hands over our heads to guide us with our goals and mentor us whenever we need. We have very brilliant seniors in the 4th year who are great programmers and have always been amazing mentors for the Programming Club, so the Programming Club invites these big brains to have an open AMA session with all of us and resolve any doubts and questions that we have regarding our coding endeavors.

Come with all your questions related to programming or your coding career, put them forward, and share all the knowledge they have to give.

The first and second year students are highly recommended to attend the talk.

   Venue:                   Porta Cabin                               
   Day and Time:      Tuesday, April 11, 10:00 PM   

The Panel constitutes of:

    Avan Rathod
    Aman Singh
    Kushagra Surana
    Aakash Hasija
    Himanshu Sikaria
    Kshitij
    Rohil Surana

Hoping to see you all there :)
